          DotaScope is an minimalistic Dota2 data platform with many features:
          <br />
          &bull; full statistic about your match.
          <br />
          &bull; accout authorization only by steam ID.(this feature under
          development)
          <br />
          &bull; current meta heroes with their winrates and builds.(this
          feature under development)
          <br />
          &bull; world{"'"}s leaderboard.(this feature under development)
          <br />
          <br />
          This project was motivated by advertising and annoying Steam
          authorization on same Dota2 data platforms such as DotaBuff, Opendota,
          etc.
          <br />
          I created DotaScope because I have a passion for developing
          applications that can help people solve various problems.

        <h3>Warning.</h3>
        <p>
          I am not responsible for profanity. <br />
          We all need to understand that no one can stop players from using
          profanity. Therefore, all nicknames have now been replaced with the
          word
          {' "'}Player{'"'}, and if a player has hidden match data, his nickname
          will be displayed as {'"'}Anonymous{'"'}.
